/* SUMMARY
* This project consists of two parts - ATM and BankApiHandler 
* ATM code has implemented basic functions of ATM which interact with bank API interface.
* You can check a 'BankApiInterface' on ATM.h
* BankApiHandler code is actual implementation of 'BankApiInterface'. 
* I made a dummy class.
* 
* As the code uses the interface, 
* The thing needs to be modified for future integration is BankApiHandler 
* accoding to real bank API.
*/

/* How to build and run
* This project is based on Microsoft Visual Studio 2022.
* I highly recomment to use visual studio when you build the project.  
* 
* In a main.cpp, you can find simple testset created from dummyAPI.
* You can run the project with testset or you can add samples using dummyAPI.
